- Authentication system, users can sign up, edit their profile, log in and log out
- Users can track stocks, up to 10 per user. The profile page will display all the current stock prices
- Users can search for stock symbols using a search bar
- Users can choose to add a stock from results of search to their portfolio
- Users can look for friends, or other users of the app, by first name, last name, or email
